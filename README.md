## 📌 About the Project

The **Memory Allocation Simulator** is designed to visually demonstrate how operating systems manage memory allocation.  
This project simulates **dynamic memory allocation** with strategies like:
- **First Fit**
- **Best Fit**
- **Worst Fit**

Users can create memory blocks, allocate/deallocate processes, and observe **fragmentation** in real-time.  
Perfect for students, educators, or anyone curious about OS internals.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Interactive memory visualization with clear UI  
✅ Add and remove processes dynamically  
✅ Choose between **First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit** algorithms  
✅ Displays **internal and external fragmentation**  
✅ User-friendly simulation for learning purposes  
✅ Lightweight and easy to set up

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**  
  - `tkinter` (GUI)  
  - `matplotlib` (for visualization, optional)  
- **Concepts:** Operating Systems, Memory Allocation, Data Structures

## 🔍 Allocation Techniques Supported

| Algorithm    | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **First Fit** | Allocates the first block large enough to hold the process |
| **Best Fit**  | Allocates the smallest available block that fits the process |
| **Worst Fit** | Allocates the largest available block for the process |

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- `pip` package manager

### Steps
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-allocation-simulator.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd memory-allocation-simulator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulator
python main.py
🖥️ Usage

Start the simulator by running python main.py.

Enter total memory size.

Add memory blocks or processes.

Select allocation strategy (First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit).

Watch the simulation update in real-time.
🔮 Future Improvements

 Add Next Fit allocation strategy

 Implement Paging and Segmentation visualization

 Web-based version using Flask/React

 Dark mode for GUI
